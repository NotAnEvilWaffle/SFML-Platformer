# SFML-Platformer
A to be platformer made with SFML and ENTT

This project was supposed to be a learning experience with using ENTT, but I've gotten a bit attached since I figured out how to do the tiles.


These assets are pulled from Cave Story, but should work with Tiled TMX maps. The layout has changed a bit between versions so at some point I will probabably write a quick guide for how to get it working with any map, but for now if you want just look over the Level.cpp to try to get a rough idea.
